Exercise 1:

The buffer which may overflow: reqpath in process_client
How structure the input to the web server: input a request path with size larger than 4096
The call stack: After run_server calls process_client, the control flow will not return to run_server

Challenge:
Use __libc_csu_init instead of accidentally to attack
Use the instruction sequence pop %r15; retq, corresponding to the machine code 41 5F C3. But instead of executing from the start of this instruction stream, jump 1 byte in, the machine code 5F C3 corresponds to the assembly pop %rdi; retq.

Exercise 5:
Two more buffers: value and envvar in http_request_headers
for buffer value, attackers can do the same thing like reqpath
for buffer envvar, attackers can not only do the same thing like reqpath and value, but also overwrite buffer value
